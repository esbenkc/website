For me, much of what I enjoy in good thoughts is the extension of my experience. An idea's ability to rewrite how I see the world.

Any text that fulfills this purpose is masterful, in my view.

Where the communication of worldviews becomes an exercise of art itself brings me great ecstase:
- Orwell communicating his *Politics and the English Language* through the fiction novel *1984*
- Black Swan framing how statistics is categorically different between domains with Extremistan and Mediocristan
- The gradual reveal of deeper and deeper research, one leading into the next, dragging the reader into *Expert Political Judgment*
- Buzsaki's fundamental disagreement with standing thought expressed in a clear worldview death and rebirth in *The Brain from Inside Out*

We see that it is possible so how can we learn to rewrite our non-fiction into stories?

I have found myself accidentally reading https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/72754976?shelf=read. I enjoy knowing things and there is a joy in understanding a topic deeper. 

What triggered me to think deeper about what makes good storytelling was a quote [I happened upon](https://tinhouse.com/podcast/ursula-k-le-guin-words-are-my-matter/) from the fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin where she mentions that she wants to fall asleep when reading non-fiction.

This, she writes at the start of one of her non-fiction works, *Words Are My Matter*.

But are these genres different?

Thinking of non-fiction, my mind goes to On Liberty, Just Kids, Twelve Years a Slave, The Soul of Man Under Socialism, AI safety literature, PLOS ONE and Philosophize This.

Of prose, Tao Te Ching, 1984, the Bible, The Witcher, Foundation Series, Djævlens Lærling, The Tao of Pooh, Maus I and II, Candide, The Fifth Science, The Outsider and Le Petit Prince come to mind.

**The boundary between these lists seems the same that separates science and art. A faulty belief that they are separate in the first place.**

Let's figure out how we can leverage the arts to communicate our non-fiction worldviews to a Reader in ways that inspire, forms images and connects the knowledge to a net of concepts.

Let's take inspiration from things like the figures in [Zoom In](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/), the design in [Quantum Country]([https://quantum.country/](https://quantum.country/qcvc)), the telling of pirate history in [Black Flag](https://www.wikiwand.com/de/Assassin%E2%80%99s_Creed_IV:_Black_Flag), the inspiration of [Pale Blue Dot](https://youtu.be/wupToqz1e2g), the excitement of [Nikola Tesla](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/My_Inventions:_The_Autobiography_of_Nikola_Tesla), the straightforwardness of [You and Your Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw), the removal of self of [Simone Weil](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simone-weil/), the intermingling of fact and fun from [Sabine Hossenfelder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oruA427cpTg), the co-exploration of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague) and the destruction of form in [YOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)




With this, I believe we can make knowledge inspiring for anyone.

Something that is more necessary than ever to let good ideas compete in what one might see as a modern propagandized, polarized and vapid infosphere.
