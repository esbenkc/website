The future is cyborg.

This post is for you if you if you saw the Extended Mind thesis and had zero doubts. If you follow Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen's tools for thought. If you read Neuromancer and lamented how little our user interfaces have developed. If your career led you through game development, brain-computer interfaces, tools for thought, or cognitive science.

Today, the cyborg is someone whose computer is their extended brain *and they acknowledge this*. They filter their information stream, design their own productivity tools, and contribute value in the global data stream. For you, this means:
- Dare to use and experiment with new tools for productivity and measure how it impacts your time
- Design your extended brain to be an augmentation, not a limitation, of your own brain
- Understand how cognition works and how extended minds work

## Tools of the trade
I implore you to experiment with your own tools but largely, working with experimental tools will be a bit hit-and-miss. Let's go through a few categories:

### Hardware
Of course, you need VR and AR glasses of some kind. 

The Oculus Quest II is absolutely incredible and I cannot recommend it enough. When I worked on the Vive, I didn't expect such a device to exist within the next few years. The resolution is slightly too low to be working in for longer periods and the Apple Vision Pro seems to be more fitting for work.

For AR, I own the XREAL Air Pro 2, an amazing piece of hardware. They're the size of large glasses, connect directly to your computer as a monitor, and simulates up to three virtual screens, allowing you to completely switch off your laptop monitor.

**Nomad hardware:** I own a secondary portable monitor which can be gotten for 

As a nomad, I also own a secondary monitor
an e-ink reader
### Software
One schism in the cyborg movement is how in-control you wish to be versus how productive you wish to be. I'm of the latter group and as a result, run MacOS.

## The AI masterclass
Several people have already written about how they use AI but it changes day by day. Here, I'll detail how I personally use it:

### Cyborgism
Cyborgism is the branch of cyborgs that dedicate their mind and brain to interfacing with AI. It's the group that consistently have the most understanding of what AIs are capable of and the group that developed Loom, among other software. Their original goal was to use AI to assist with ambitious alignment research, though it seems like they've rather gone deeper into how AI thinks instead.

## Designing your home
For EnigmA, we have a raspberry pi run our speakers, our lights, and a monitor detailing relevant information for the day.

## Reading list
You're probably curious where you can find more information about this eclectic group of people you are now a part of. They seem to be of all ages; emerging from the hacker movements of the 1900s and the founders of the internet all the way to the AI tech founders of the 2020s. Let's start off with the concrete readings:
- Tools for Thought
- Quantum Country
- Michael Nielsen's new work
- The Extended Mind Thesis

And if you are interested in diving into the mindset (bar the cringe-y 90s sexism):
- Neuromancer
- The Hacker Manifesto
