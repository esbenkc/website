4Chan got our key. They deliberately spent $10,000 to “run us dry” because we “are AI ethicists”. They wrote derogatory comments about my co-workers. And what really makes me angry. They didn't do anything useful with the $10,000 of OpenAI API credits. They just made pedophilic role-playing in a some sexual role-playing chatbot app.
