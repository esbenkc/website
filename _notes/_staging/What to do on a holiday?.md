- I'm taking a few weeks off
- Disconnect, evaluate, and deliberate

Testing what's up. What is happening now. What is the total active time. Is that in seconds or in minutes?  

to do during holiday
- Disconnect: Fork from my own life
	- Disconnect from digital life
	- Get out of the mindsets I have in everyday life
	- Starting and finishing a new project
	- Play music
	- Travel away
	- No YouTube, work platform, etc.
- Evaluate: 
	- Write about everything - write the handbook of life
	- Personal reviews and evaluation
	- Implement new habits: Health, diet, sleep, etc.
	- Emotional calibration - connecting with my stress
	- Catch up with old friends
	- LOVE Goodreads book recommendation feature, it's the most fire books out there
- Deliberate: Challenge my viewpoints
	- Deliberate about my philosophy
	- Meeting new people and hearing their perspectives - especially from completely different backgrounds
	- Read a specific list of books or listen to specific podcasts
	- Learn specific skills, e.g. leadership skills, and have the time to implement them in mindset
