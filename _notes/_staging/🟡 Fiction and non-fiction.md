For me, much of what I enjoy in good thoughts is the extension of my experience. The ability to see the world in a new light.

Any text that fulfills this purpose is masterful, in my view.

Where the communication of worldviews then becomes an exercise of art itself brings me great ecstase:
- Black Swan framing statistical theory as Extremistan and Mediocristan to explain economic fallacies. 
- McElreath's stories to showcase Bayesian statistics.
- Buzsaki's reframing of *fundamental concepts* of thought; a complex exercise in meta-thinking.

How can we then learn to rewrite our non-fiction into stories; be these fiction or not?

I have found myself accidentally reading [quite a few non-fiction books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/72754976?shelf=read). I enjoy knowing things and there is a joy in understanding a topic deeper.

Recently, [I happened upon](https://tinhouse.com/podcast/ursula-k-le-guin-words-are-my-matter/) a quote from the writer Ursula K. De Guin where she mentions that she wants to fall asleep when reading non-fiction.

This, she writes at the start of one of her non-fiction works, "Words Are My Matter".

But are these genres different?

Thinking of non-fiction, my mind goes to Expert Political Judgment, Just Kids, Twelve Years a Slave, The Soul of Man Under Socialism, PLOS ONE and Philosophize This.

Of prose, Tao Te Ching, 1984, the Bible, The Witcher, Foundation Series, Djævlens Lærling, The Tao of Pooh, Maus I and II, Candide, The Fifth Science, The Outsider and Le Petit Prince come to mind.

The boundary between these lists seems the same that separates science and art. A faulty belief that they are separate in the first place (and need to stay so).

So what does one get out of these texts?

Let us focus on how we can communicate our worldviews to a Reader in ways that inspire, forms images and connects the knowledge to a net of concepts.

Let us take inspiration from things like the figures in [Zoom In](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/), the design in [Quantum Country]([https://quantum.country/](https://quantum.country/qcvc)), the telling of history in [Black Flag](https://www.wikiwand.com/de/Assassin%E2%80%99s_Creed_IV:_Black_Flag), the inspiration of [Pale Blue Dot](https://youtu.be/wupToqz1e2g), the exciterment of [Tesla](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/My_Inventions:_The_Autobiography_of_Nikola_Tesla), the straightforwardness of [You and Your Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) and the removal of self of [Simone Weil](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simone-weil/) for the ideas to shine.

With this, I believe we can make knowledge inspiring for anyone.

Something that is more necessary than ever to let good ideas compete in what one might see as a modern propagandized, polarized and vapid infosphere.
