Today is my first break in a long time. I planned it a year ago and I'm happy I did. With amazing opportunities knocking on my door, it's very hard to dedicate time to ensure that I stay connected and aligned with who I am.

I regularly enjoy two types of breaks:
- One is for family - here, I aim to create a deeper relationship with the ones I care about and who care about me. I will have these at least once a year and they are largely sacred.
- The second is the scholarly retreat, a sabbatical for yourself - this is a chance to fork the repository of life, to experiment and deliberate, to evaluate and reconnect.

I'll talk about the second one, because I think everyone (yes, you!) can gain immense value from these.
## Do a scholarly getaway
Often when I impose a break into my life, it becomes a catalyst to round off a chapter of business and engage in a chapter of life. It gives me the chance to reevaluate and retarget my objective function. In my experience, when you reconnect with your core beliefs and principles, your work will become several times more impactful. And history seems to back it up:

When covid hit, Wolfram revisited a decades-old passion project to find the [foundations of physics](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/). Muhammed went to the [cave of Hira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_first_revelation) to deliberate his takeover of Hejaz. Steve Jobs found that UX was the best way to destroy the barriers between humans and Experience after [learning Zen Buddhism in the East](https://www.austingentry.com/steve-jobs-religion/). Marx had nothing but thinking to do [on Engels' dime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels#:~:text=Engels%20also%20supported%20Marx%20financially,Kapital%20(1885%20and%201894).). Jesus spent [18 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_years_of_Jesus) doing God-knows-what. Newton wrote Principia Mathematica [during the Black Plague lockdown](https://reasonandreflection.wordpress.com/2020/05/21/isaac-newton-and-the-plague-of-1665-66-perhaps-the-greatest-year-in-science/). Virginia Woolf retreated from London life and wrote some of [her best work](https://bookertalk.com/at-home-with-virginia-woolf/). There's even the concept of the productive years in mathematics, that you aren't able to do good work later in life because you're invited for too many talks ([though it's largely false](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/191929/are-there-any-serious-investigations-of-whether-mathematicians-do-their-best-wo)). The list goes on.

## You should travel alone
If you are normally surrounded by activity, I suggest you take a long break by yourself. Go somewhere where you are forced to re-engage with life every day, a getaway where you don't get distracted by the internet because *life is too interesting*.

I first did this in 2018 when I decided to go to Thailand without enough money to get back home, forcing myself to start a business. By going alone, I learned more about myself through positive challenge and came to know many wonderful people. In comparison, I've been on travels with friends that were immense fun, but that I could not classify as a realization or development of my self.



## What to do during a hiatus?



Last year, I found that I needed a philosophical break.





- I'm taking a few weeks off
- Disconnect, evaluate, and deliberate

Testing what's up. What is happening now. What is the total active time. Is that in seconds or in minutes?  

to do during holiday
- Disconnect: Fork from my own life
	- Disconnect from digital life
	- Get out of the mindsets I have in everyday life
	- Starting and finishing a new project
	- Play music
	- Travel away
	- No YouTube, work platform, etc.
- Evaluate: 
	- Write about everything - write the handbook of life
	- Personal reviews and evaluation
	- Implement new habits: Health, diet, sleep, etc.
	- Emotional calibration - connecting with my stress
	- Catch up with old friends
	- LOVE Goodreads book recommendation feature, it's the most fire books out there
- Deliberate: Challenge my viewpoints
	- Deliberate about my philosophy
	- Meeting new people and hearing their perspectives - especially from completely different backgrounds
	- Read a specific list of books or listen to specific podcasts
	- Learn specific skills, e.g. leadership skills, and have the time to implement them in mindset
