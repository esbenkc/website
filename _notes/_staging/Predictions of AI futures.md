As an AI safety researcher, I've drunk the Kool-Aid that AI will be transformative for society. In [Rob Bensinger's words](https://x.com/robbensinger/status/1801306833325592759), I'm an AGI alarmist. I expect AGI to bring immense good and have the potential to destroy society. I also expect that we can solve most of the issues with some globally ambitious engineering.


## Predictions for AI
Again, let me back up the above discussion with concrete predictions that also go beyond cybermorphism:

- Open weights models will catch up to end-2025 performance, even to o1, at the end of 2026. With this, private models will begin to be developed (65%).
- Most human-like internet activity (browsing, information gathering, app interaction) will be conducted by agents in 2030 (90%).
- Within a year, we'll have GPT-5 (...or equivalent) (80%) which will upend the agent economy, creating a slow internet (or the expectation thereof), where every action needs checking and security to avoid [cyber offense risks](https://cybercapabilities.org/) and tragedies of the commons (70%).
- Trillions of persistent generally intelligent agents will exist on the web by 2030 (90%), as defined by unique memory-persistent instantiations of an arbitrary number of agent types.
- A sentient and fully digital lifeform will be spawned before 2035, irrespective of the rights it receives (99% and I will argue my case).
- Despite the tele-operated robots at the "We, Robot" event, the Optimus bot will be seen as the most capable personal robotic platform by 2028 (30%) (and I will own one; conditional 90%).
- Before 2035, we will reach something akin to a singularity; a 20% US GDP growth year-over-year, two years in a row, largely driven by general intelligence (30% probability, highly dependent on the perpetuity of US democracy).
- Biometric authentication will be the de-facto 2FA for most password-protected systems (70%). Iris scanners will be available on your "edge device" (whether phone or AR device; conditional 50%).
- The web (50%< of ISP traffic) will have federated or decentralized identity controls that tracks and ensures actions are done by humans before 2035 (75%).
