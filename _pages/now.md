# What I'm doing now

## Innovating how AI safety research is done

I'm the co-director of [Apart](https://apartresearch.com), a decentralized collective of AI safety researchers making research happen in new ways. I'm currently quite invested in making technical AI safety scale into for-profit companies _at scale_.

Specifically, I'm

- making the YC of AI safety
- researching cyber offense capabilities in LLMs
- researching deceptive conversational patterns in LLMs
- running international research hackathons
- creating new ways of doing research
