Apart is a research lab. For a long time, I thought that was it. However, there's *extremely few* non-profit research labs in the world. And of those, there's *extremely few* doing useful research. And of those, there's *extremely few* doing research in new ways. And of those, there *extremely few* doing AI safety. The final list's length becomes **one**; Apart Research.

I'm not a sales person, never have been. However, sometimes there's a vision that you can communicate that people can easily understand. 
- "We want to save the world" is boring, plaché, and pretentious.
- "We hope to bring about a safer future with AI" is too apologetic and pessimistic.
- "We make AI safety inevitable" is pretentious.
- "Apart Research is a decentralized collective of AI safety researchers. We facilitate and run events and fellowships for ambitious action on AI risk." fits the vibe well and brings about our social mission. However, it lacks a bit of clarity on what the output of our work is.
- we are not cringe, we focus on AI safety, and we do it in the most impactful way we know how
- "We're optimist researchers, we focus on AI safety, and we do it in the most impactful way we know how." is a bit wordy but otherwise neat - I like the honesty

A short story:
- Apart founded because we need to take action on AI safety now
- late 2022 was more like "hacker vibes lets hack yo make shit happen here's a cool speaker and were gonna do research"
- mid 2022 was also like "we're gonna try so many different ais interventions and find the most impactful"
- early 2023 was like "let's share what is going on with our 1000s of followers"
- mid 2023 was like "alright let's publish research from this awesome place we're at right now and help people and individuals get out there"
- late 2023 was like "let's professionalize and make everything much better and scalable"
- early 2024 was dealing with technical debt and fundraising with "we're gonna make hackathons and lab happen and here's why"
- mid 2024 is much like what the website mentions
- now is the vibes of the incubation project and some of the "alright, back to hacker basics, enthusiasm, and having the time and freedom to do things the most impactful way we know how and be confident in their impact"

What makes funders excited?

- Original thoughts on how to run organizations, having principled opinions about this
    - E.g. got first funding after I wrote an article on why every non-profit organization should be hyper transparent about their KPIs
- Unique approach to impact and the **vision** of what they're supporting
	- Us having unique and exciting goals to pursue based on original reasoning that seems good and not copied from somewhere else

Now secondly, where do we want to tell the story? Obviously, we want our message to be clear across platforms. For us, that includes website, twitter, newsletter, linkedin, and any communication related to our events.

Now, which type of design can help us communicate this vision and message?
